# Work Shift Calculator
A small simple script to calculate time spent at work each day

### Requirements
| requirement | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Python      | 3.6+    |


This script is purely developed for my own personal needs and therefore is likely not nuke proof to all ege cases.

I use this script to calculate time spent working each day when my brain is too fried to do even the simplest numeracy by the end of the day.

I developed this script to try and help me from working too many long hours.

### Usage

Command: `python main.py`

Expected output:
```
Enter the start time in 24 hour format (HH:MM): 08:00
Enter the lunch break in 24 hour format (HH:MM): 00:30
Enter the end time in 24 hour format (HH:MM): 16:00
------------------------------------
Start Time: 08:00:00
Lunch Break: 00:30:00
End Time: 16:00:00
------------------------------------
Time worked excluding break: 8:00:00
Time worked including break: 7:30:00
```
